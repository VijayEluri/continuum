Continuum Release Integration Branch
------------------------------------
This branch was created for development on the release management portion 
of Continuum.  Continuum will be able to act as a delegate to perform 
releases in place of other release tools like Maven.  There will be a 
specific interfact that each release tool will follow and that is still 
up for discussion.  Please send any inquiries, complains or suggestions 
to continuum-dev@maven.apache.org.
