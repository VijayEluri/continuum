        * <<Name>> The unique identifier of the schedule. This is a required field.
        
        * <<Description>> Brief description of the configured schedule. This is a required field.
        
        * <<Cron Expression>> Determines the exact time interval that the build schedule executes.
        
        * <<Maximum job execution time (seconds)>> This sets the maximum time for a job to be executed.
            This is a required field.
        
        * <<Quiet Period (seconds)>> This a setting that delays the build if there has been a commit
            in the defined number of seconds prior. This is useful when using CVS, since commits are
            not atomic and a developer might be committing midway through an update. It is not typically
            needed if using Subversion.
        
        *<<Add Build Queue>> Move build queues from the left hand list box to the right hand list box by
            clicking the appropriate buttons in between the two list boxes. All build queues on the right
            hand list box will be attached to the schedule.
        
        * <<Enabled>> When selected, scheduled build will be executed.
