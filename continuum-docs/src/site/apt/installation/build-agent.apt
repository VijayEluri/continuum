Installing and Configuring a Build Agent

    First, {{{http://continuum.apache.org/download.html}download}} the Continuum Build Agent standalone
    distribution or webapp.
    
    <<Note>>: It is recommended to use build agents that come with the release of Continuum (Continuum Master) to be used.
    While 1.3.x build agents can be used with 1.4.x Continuum (Continuum Master), using a later version of build agent than the
    Continuum (Continuum Master) will not work.

* Standalone

    The Build Agent is available as a separate standalone Jetty-bundled
    webapp.  Installing it is as simple as extracting it to a preferred
    directory.

    The Build Agent runs on a specific port (defaulting to 8181), so it is possible
    to install multiple Build Agents in one machine.  It is also possible to
    install Agents in the same machine as the Master.  To configure the Build Agent
    to run using a different port, edit the
    <<<$CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME/conf/jetty.xml>>> file.

    Another configuration file to look at is the
    <<<$CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME/conf/continuum-buildagent.xml>>>.  This file must
    be manually edited, as there is no web interface for this configuration.

+--------------+
<continuum-buildagent-configuration>
  <buildOutputDirectory>/path/to/build/agent/data/build-output-directory</buildOutputDirectory>
  <workingDirectory>/path/to/build/agent/data/working-directory</workingDirectory>
  <continuumServerUrl>http://builds.example.com:8080/continuum/master-xmlrpc</continuumServerUrl>
  <installations>
    <installation>
      <name>Maven 2 Home</name>
      <type>maven2</type>
      <varValue>/Applications/apache-maven-2.0.9</varValue>
    </installation>
  </installations>
</continuum-buildagent-configuration>
+----------------+

    A minimal configuration will have the following fields:

    * <<<buildOutputDirectory>>> - similar to the build output directory of Continuum

    * <<<workingDirectory>>> - similar to the working directory of Continuum

    * <<<continuumServerUrl>>> - the url pointing to the XML-RPC context of the Master Build Agent

    * <<<installations>>> - a list of the installations available on the build agent, including Maven, Ant, JDK, etc.

  Note that all of your agents need not be identical, as there is a way to control which agent Continuum chooses by using a
  {{{../administrator_guides/build-agent-groups.html}Build Agent Group}}. In addition, you need to {{{../administrator_guides/buildEnvironment.html} configure}}
  the Build Environment from the Master in order to specify which installation to use for the build.

  Now start the Build Agent by executing the startup script available in
  <<<$CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME/bin/>>>.  For example:

+---+
continuum-buildagent start
+---+

  or if you are on Windows

+---+
continuum-buildagent console
+---+

  Next, enable the <<Distributed Builds>> option in the {{{../administrator_guides/configuration.html}General Configuration}},
  and {{{../administrator_guides/build-agents.html}add the agent}} to the Continuum master server.

~~ TODO:  Does the Jetty bundle still want CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME set?

* Webapp

  The build agent is also available as a web application which you can install into your own container.

  The build agent needs two things in order to function properly:  A <<<CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME>>> environment variable,
  and a <<<continuum-buildagent.xml>>> configuration file in <<<$CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME/conf>>>.

  First, set the environment variable:

+---+
export CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME=/path/to/build/agent/home
+---+

  or

+---+
set CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME=c:\path\to\build\agent\home
+---+

  Next, create the <<<continuum-buildagent.xml>>> file as shown above, and save it in <<<$CONTINUUM_BUILDAGENT_HOME/conf>>>.
  You will need to create these directories.

  Finally, drop the webapp into your container, and start it.
