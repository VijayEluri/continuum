Building Projects

    For Ant and Maven builds the following system properties will be added via -D command line:

    * <<<continuum.project.group.name>>>

    * <<<continuum.project.lastBuild.state>>> : last build state int flag

    * <<<continuum.project.lastBuild.number>>>

    * <<<continuum.project.nextBuild.number>>>

    * <<<continuum.project.id>>>

    * <<<continuum.project.name>>>

    * <<<continuum.project.version>>>

    When building projects, the build order is determined by the inter-dependency of the projects.
    This would mean that the dependencies of a project are built first.

    In cases when a project group can build projects in parallel build queues but one of those projects depend
    on another project, the inter-dependent projects will build in the same build queue.

    Projects can be built in two ways:

    [[1]] {{{./schedule_build.html} Scheduled Builds}}

    [[2]] {{{./forced_build.html} Forced Builds}}

    []

    Projects will have the <<in queue>> icon once the forced build or a scheduled build is triggered. This means that the project is either in the <<prepare build
    queue>> or in the <<build queue>>.

    Checkout or update of projects takes longer with distributed builds because after an SCM checkout or SCM update, an SCM changelog follows to get the "latest
    update date" needed to determine whether projects should build or not.
