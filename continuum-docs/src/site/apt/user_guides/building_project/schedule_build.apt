Scheduling Project Build

    Schedules determine the project's time interval to build.

    When scheduled builds are triggered, there is no dependency ordering between project groups
    and the following happens:

    * Projects are updated from the SCM.
      These are queued under the <<Prepare Build Queues>> section in <<Queues>> page.

    * Builds of the projects are executed.
      These are queued under the <<Build Queues>> in <<Queues>> page.

    To configure a scheduled build:

    [[1]] Create a schedule. You can refer to {{{../../administrator_guides/schedules.html} Managing Schedules}} section.

    [[2]] Add a build definition to a project using the schedule created in step 1 for the <<Schedule>> field.
       You can refer to the section {{{../managing_builddef/index.html} Managing Build Definitions}}.

    *Note* In a distributed build setup, the project builds are not executed if no build agent is
    configured in the build environment that is attached to the project's build definition.

    To view the results of the build, refer to {{{./build_results.html}Build Results Management}}.
